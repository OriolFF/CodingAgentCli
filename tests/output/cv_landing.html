I notice you've created multiple versions of the CV landing page file. Since the file has already been successfully created (as indicated by your last message showing it was created with 9630 characters), I won't create another duplicate file.

The current version in tests/output/cv_landing.html contains:
- Material 3 color scheme implementation
- Responsive layout
- Hero section with name and title
- Work experience timeline
- Technical skills grid
- Projects showcase
- Contact form
- Clean, modern design

Would you like me to make any modifications to the existing file or create a different version? I can:
1. Add more sections (education, certifications)
2. Modify the color scheme
3. Adjust the layout
4. Add interactive elements
5. Optimize for mobile
6. Create a different style

Let me know what changes you'd like and I'll help implement them.
